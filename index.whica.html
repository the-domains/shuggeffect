We have created a “Lee Library” that any employee can pull from and gain knowledge on leadership, marketing, self-improvement, money management, and even fitness. It has been very well accepted. While most of the books are available to read or listen to at the team members leisure, we do have some books that are mandatory for every employee and others that are department specific. Just like any new endeavor it has not been perfect, but it has been a piece of the puzzle that has transformed us into a company that is unified, focused, and excited about where we are headed. Our first mandatory read for all team members is “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Through this, we have literally watched team members change before our eyes. We’ve seen changes from the top down. Much of the change can be attributed to reading, opening our imagination, knowledge, compassion, understanding, and much more (along with a lot of prayer and consulting with the man upstairs). We have seen a transformation take place and we plan to continue to encourage all team members to take advantage of the opportunity to be the best version of themselves through continual learning. Watch for our very own book coming soon! More details to come.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-3 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg

wanted to eat candy and lose weight? What if someone told you they wanted to get somewhere fast, but they wanted to crawl there? What about if someone told you that they wanted to be a better person, but didn’t want to learn anything? Of course, we would say this person is crazy. You can’t get what you want by doing the opposite of what you’re trying to accomplish. Not really a shocker, right? Well, what if someone told you that they wanted more clients, but they didn’t want to treat the ones they have like gold? What if a friend told you he wanted committed employees, but he didn’t want to take the time to make them feel like they mattered? What if another friend told you she wanted to start a company that inspired people, but only if the inspiration resulted in a sale? While the second set of examples sound just as crazy, many businesses operate daily with the assumption that they’ll get the desired results by doing the opposite of what really works. If you want more clients you must, must, must treat the ones you currently have like gold. If you want committed employees you must listen to them and treat them like people and not things. An inspiring company attracts, period. Don’t hinge inspiration on what you’ll get back…just give it. If you want to grow in a way that really lasts, you must consider the whole package. If you skip something or slack off in one area the whole operation suffers. Instead of saying “what if” as a way of seeing how little you can get away with, start saying “what if” I gave a little more or “what if” I went out of my way. It will certainly bring the results you desire.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="74"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1"

data-reactid="116">Last week I was able to go to my first Daddy Daughter dance, and I had an absolute blast! It was a memory that I will always hold near and dear to my heart. When we arrived I was relieved of a fear that my little girl would be nervously attached to my leg. I was happy to see her dancing right in the middle of all the action. It was a mosh pit of little girls dancing to all their favorite songs. I was proud to see my little Ava had invested herself with enough of the girls that it carried over into the evening. Over the school year, she must have become invested with her friends through playing together, helping each other, and in some way giving and receiving value to each other. Then, when the big night came, it was organic (a natural occurrence) that she would be where the action was. I couldn’t have paid to have this happen if I wanted to. Ava and her friends could teach us a few things about making it up the Google ladder. Yes, a bunch of six-year-olds could teach us a thing or two. Maybe, just maybe, it isn’t about paying for someone to get your website to the top, or creating some hidden code that makes Google think you are more relevant and valuable than you really are. Maybe it is actually about being valuable? If you take the time to invest in your customers, allow them to provide honest feedback, provide them with valuable resources, and make it difficult for them not to talk positively about you with their friends, Google will have no choice but to bring you up the list. Regardless of their “new” algorithm. Sound like too much work? Sounds like it would take too long? If you’re looking for true, lasting friends/customers that will jump in the mosh pit with you, then there is no alternative. Bring value with what you do and you won’t have to rely on tactics and tricks. You’ll organically grow relationships that will last much longer than any paid click or search. Sometimes, it literally pays to think like a six- year-old.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="117"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="118"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="119"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="120"><span data-reactid="121"><!-- react-empty: 122 --><h2 data-reactid="123"><a data-reactid="124">Shuggeffect</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="125"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="126"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="127"><div class="Link" data-reactid="128"><a data-reactid="129">Shuggeffect RSS</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="130"></div></section></div></div>

It will certainly bring the results you desire."}]},"89ca3e0c-f74c-453e-83bb-3d5354111516":{"id":"89ca3e0c-f74c-453e-83bb-3d5354111516","index":4,"created_by":"c07fa4ff-5309-4576-972d-77cd0087483e","updated_by":"c07fa4ff-5309-4576-972d-77cd0087483e","created_at":"2016-05-13T21:02:39.844Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T21:04:31.725Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-05-14-the-history-of-lee-printing.md","_title":"THE HISTORY OF LEE PRINTING","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"the-history-of-lee-printing/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"title":"THE HISTORY OF LEE PRINTING","description":"Bruce Lee","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"65d83e78-1934-4dad-8ebe-127b7cd969d6","item":"89ca3e0c-f74c-453e-83bb-3d5354111516","type":"h2","html":"<h2>THE HISTORY OF LEE PRINTING</h2>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"THE HISTORY OF LEE PRINTING"},{"id":"aaa4e5ff-0028-4564-a8bd-a293d2182229","item":"89ca3e0c-f74c-453e-83bb-3d5354111516","type":"image","html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3be14e7a-39bb-4487-bdfb-3faea3bf8065.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":"","starred":true,"description":"Bruce Lee","authors":[{"name":"","url":""}],"coverPrefs":{"crop":true,"filter":true,"overlay":true}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6498b3ffc54d179f2aa51a2ae21bf744/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ff47e6adb86aa427deff160cc3c1042c38635c17b.jpg&width=1440","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3be14e7a-39bb-4487-bdfb-3faea3bf8065.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f47e6adb86aa427deff160cc3c1042c38635c17b.jpg","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6498b3ffc54d179f2aa51a2ae21bf744/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ff47e6adb86aa427deff160cc3c1042c38635c17b.jpg&width=1440"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/de77745fbfad8f5efb7c7eb438aeed36/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ff47e6adb86aa427deff160cc3c1042c38635c17b.jpg&width=1280"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fca51bbbd10548c406575436783f64b9/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ff47e6adb86aa427deff160cc3c1042c38635c17b.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b2acd6483d8302a63c164703ce20fb68/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ff47e6adb86aa427deff160cc3c1042c38635c17b.jpg&width=360"}],"ratio":"505:946","aspect":0.5338266384778013,"orientation":"portrait","width":1798,"height":3368,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"faces":[{"x":726.3515625,"y":363.17578125,"width":541.203125,"height":541.203125,"confidence":5.031202}],"colors":[[2,2,2],[148,148,155],[118,116,123],[65,63,69],[213,211,218]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[370.296875,893.697265625],[1794.515625,3364.716796875]],"confidence":0.411278,"center":[1011.1953125,1680.578125],"radius":844.814517578125},"exif":{}}},{"id":"4225de6f-4e22-49e1-ab02-7ba80093434b","item":"89ca3e0c-f74c-453e-83bb-3d5354111516","type":"text","html":"<p>We figured many of you have probably never heard the true story behind our history. We’d like to tell you that whole story now…. In 1889, a young man by the name of Ho Kom-tong. traveled to Mt. Clemens, Michigan from Hong Kong. He was recovering from a sword wound and had heard many wonderful stories about the healing powers of the city’s mineral baths. He had high hopes that the mineral baths would quicken his recovery. After arriving to Mt. Clemens he found that indeed the baths were a great tool for his wounds, and he recovered very quickly. He was so pleased by his results, he made a promise to return to Mt. Clemens with his family. Upon returning home to Hong Kong, he learned that his young son, Lee Hoi-chuen had become gravely ill. Kom-tong put out a plea to his village with hopes of sending his young son to Mt. Clemens to be healed by the salt baths. Ho Kom-tong was never able to return, but his son Lee Hoi-chuen was. After several weeks of treatment, Hoi-chuen made a full recovery. He quickly fell in love with the local people and established his family in Mt. Clemens. He married a young woman who worked in the bathhouses. Her name was Grace Ho. The two of them lived in Mt. Clemens, where they had children and started their own judo club, creatively named, “The Mt. Clemens Judo Club.” All of their children gravitated towards Americanized sports and activities, but one of their sons held firm to Chinese Martial Arts. He excelled and was known for his quickness and power. The Mt. Clemens Judo Club was located above a printing company. Their young son would have to enter The Judo Club through the entrance of the printing company. He was very fond of the company and they were very kind to his family. As he grew into somewhat of a local celebrity, and also gained some international popularity, he had it in his heart to purchase the printing company to help his family financially. In 1964, this young man approached the owners of the printing company and offered an undisclosed amount. The owners told the young man that two others had just recently made offers, and surprisingly, they were all identical offers. The owners of the printing company decided that the final offer would be accepted based on the winner of a proposed judo match. Who ever would win the judo match would have the winning offer. All three parties agreed and a match date was set. That rainy morning came quickly and all three came prepared for battle. The match progressed, and it was a very even match until one of the men seemed to come alive with two quick “Hane Makikomi” (Spring Wrap-around Throw) that ended the match. The winner was easily decided. The winner of the match was Bill Lesperance. Throughout the match, Bill gained a great respect for the young man who had grown-up up-stairs in The Judo Club. Mr. Lesperance said, “I may have won the match, but your name comes with respect and power. I will name the printing company after you. We will never forget your quickness and strength.” The young man responded, “My name is Bruce Lee.” Bill responded, “Then the name will be Lee Printing.” The third party in the match, to this day, is bitter about the loss. He was, and is still labeled as one of the most dangerous fighters in all of history. In 1972, he again found himself fighting with the young man from The Judo Club. In the movie, “Way of the Dragon” Chuck Norris lost another great battle to Bruce Lee. We are very proud of our history and remain “Old As Dirt,” and cooler than Chuck Norris.</p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"We figured many of you have probably never heard the true story behind our history.
