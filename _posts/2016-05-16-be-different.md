# BE DIFFERENT
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a72807cc-12f0-4672-aefe-861c301fd4ff.jpg)

Think about your company or the company you work for... Why should I choose you? Are you the biggest? Are you the cheapest? Or are you different? If you're the biggest, what happens when someone gets bigger? If you're the cheapest, what happens when someone beats your price? If you're different, what happens when you're not different anymore? I guess you'll have to try to be the biggest or the cheapest. Be different. The rest will come.
